You see a farmhouse in the distance. It's getting cold, you are hungry, tired and you smell chicken roasting over a wood fire. There are 2 doors to choose from, but there is a Brontosaurus running after you so you have to choose quicklu, 1 or 2

##Door One
*You are invited in. There is a party going on, lots of food and drink.*

##Door Two
*You open the door, peak in, it closes behind you. It's very hot due to the large oven in the middle of the room. You are not a guest, you are dinner. Into the oven you go. Bye Bye*


If you chose Door one you have been having a great time hanging out by the fireplace, drinking beer and eating pizza. A scary clown offers you you  magic mushroom icecream, everyone is watching. Who doesn't like icecream, right? 

You have 2 choices, eat it or pass

##Eat the iceCream
*Wow, the icecream is awesome. As you eat it, the bowl turns into a bag of gold coins, SCORE!*

##Don't Eat the Icecream
*You decline the icecream, claiming lactose intolerance, but the clown calls BS, cause he's watched you eat Pizza. You have pissed off the scary clown. He drags you outside and drops you donw a bottemless well to spend eternity falling*


Now your tummy is full and you have a bag of gold coins, the party is over and it's time to hit the road
