You see a farmhouse in the distance. It's getting cold, you are hungry, tired and you smell chicken roasting over a wood fire. There are 2 doors to choose from, but there is a Brontasaurus running after you so you have ot choose quick.

##Decsion 1
#Door One
*You are invited in. There is a party going on, lots of food and drink.

#Door Two
*You open the door, peak in, it closes behind you. It's very hot due to the large oven in the middle of the room. You are not a guest, you are dinner. Into the oven you go. Bye Bye
