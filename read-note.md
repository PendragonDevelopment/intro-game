#You are in the Forest of Eden, this note contains your options.#

There are three things that you need to complete your journey out of the forest. You can only pick one at this time. The item you chose you may use on your journey.

##1. A torch - this will allow you to see at night.##
If Sean picks the torch then they can go to the Mystic Cave or The Lighthouse.
If Sean picks the Lighthouse, he dies because it collapses on him after booking his Vestigo trip to the top of it.
If Sean picks the Mystic Cave he can trade in his knife for a sword.





##2. A sword - this will allow you to kill off attackers.##
If Sean picks the sword he can now hunt for food or fight a nomad for his coins.
If Sean hunts he will die because the bear killed him. The bear's name is Jim.
