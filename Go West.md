#Go West
##Scenario 1

You come to a large river with rushing water and very steep banks. There is an old wooden bridge crossing the river, but it looks like it may not support your weight. You also spot a small path leading down the river bank to the right. 

Not wanting to turn back, you decide to...

- A: Take your chances on the old bridge.
- B: Follow the path and look for another place to cross the river.

Result A:
You carefully make your way across the old bridge. As you set foot on the opposite river bank you hear a loud CRASH and turn to see the bridge collapsing into the water. That was close.

Result B:
You start down the path, but quickly lose your footing and slip in mud. As you slide down toward the waterâ€™s edge, a large crocodile emerges and opens its gigantic mouth. You are eaten in one bite.
