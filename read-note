You are in the Forest of Eden. We know why you are there, but to prove yourself you must figure your way out.

There are three things that you need to complete your journey out of the forest. You can only pick one at this time. The item you chose you may use on your journey.
1. A torch - this will allow you to see at night.
2. A sword - this will allow you to kill off attackers.
3. A shield - this will allow you to defend yourself when be attacked.

Chose wisely.
